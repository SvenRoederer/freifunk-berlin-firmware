Subject: sysupgrade: call Freifunk-berlin-free-ram script earlier

All purly backup-related option will have already exited before explicitly, so
we are going to upgrade the firmware. Start freeing as much ram as possible,
before starting with the original OpenWrt sysupgrade procedure.
Call this here only, to not call teh "free-Ram" steps when only doing a backup,
as the script will reduce the functionality of the whole system. Doing backups
should not change the system-state (stopping services, networ, ...)
